Strike lightning where you look in Minecraft.  
This is my lightning bolt mod folder that contains all the relevant code and resources for the development of this Minecraft Forge mod.  
Inside the build/libs folder is the compiled mod .jar file which is meant to be placed inside the mods folder of minecraft and depends on minecraft forge to run properly.
